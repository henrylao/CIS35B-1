Lab1:
The index of the optionSet and option are staring from 0.
For example, the user want to get the optionSet "color" which is in the index 0 of the array.
User will enter 1 to access it.
But for now, the user still need to enter 0 to access it because it is not necessary to interact with real user yet.

If update file failed, it will display a message and user could run program again and fix the error.
The user must enter the correct optionSet name like "Color" to succesfully update the name.
